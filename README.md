# NH Catalog

A website to track your Animal Crossing New Horizons catalog completion and share wishlists in multiple languages.
It was built with love ~~and many tears~~ in nuxt.js and koa.

## Credit and thanks

Most images are from [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1XSLItEbUltVep8qP6691AAPg6EXf_DUR), and a lot of item information is from [this amazing spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hxrdp7oxtK-J5x9u1-rzChUpLtkv3t0_kNGdS6dtyWI/).
