# NH Catalog

A website to track your Animal Crossing New Horizons catalog completion and share wishlists in multiple languages.
It was built with love ~~and many tears~~ in nuxt.js and koa.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
